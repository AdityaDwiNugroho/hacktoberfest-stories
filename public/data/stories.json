      "story": "I am pretty new to contributing to open source, but have been a fan of open source software forever. The idea that a group of people can collectively create products that are sometimes close to or even better than mega corporations is what surprised me. This motivated me to learn how to contribute to open source and here I am, trying to slowly learn various aspects of contributing.",

  "title": "My Open Source Journey Started with Curiosity",
  "story": "I got interested in open source through programs like GSoC and Code4GovTech. However, due to a lack of experience at the time, I decided to start exploring GitHub and contributing on my own. My first real contribution was to the Medic organization, which is a part of Code4GovTech. After that, I contributed to WPRig and several other projects. These early steps helped me understand how open source works, and I’ve been learning ever since. It’s been a rewarding journey of growth, and I encourage beginners to start small and stay consistent.",
