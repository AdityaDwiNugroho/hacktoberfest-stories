  "story": "I got interested in open source through programs like GSoC and Code4GovTech. However, due to a lack of experience at the time, I decided to start exploring GitHub and contributing on my own. My first real contribution was to the Medic organization, which is a part of Code4GovTech. After that, I contributed to WPRig and several other projects. These early steps helped me understand how open source works, and I’ve been learning ever since. It’s been a rewarding journey of growth, and I encourage beginners to start small and stay consistent.",

    "title": "My First Contribution After Months of Tutorial Hell",
    "story": "I've been learning React for about six months now. Mostly following tutorials on YouTube, building the same to-do apps and weather apps everyone builds, then abandoning them halfway through. My GitHub looks pretty empty because honestly, I never thought my code was good enough to push. I'd start projects, get stuck on something, Google it for hours, then just give up and start a new tutorial. Classic tutorial hell. When Hacktoberfest came around, I wanted to participate but every project I looked at seemed way too advanced. Then I found this one. Just adding a story to a JSON file. No complex algorithms, no fancy React components, just... sharing something real. And I still hesitated for three days before actually doing it. I kept thinking 'my story isn't interesting enough' or 'I haven't contributed to anything real yet so what do I even say?' But then I realized that IS my story - the hesitation, the self-doubt, the endless tutorials without actually building anything original. I'm not employed as a developer yet. I'm not even sure I'm good enough to apply for jobs. But I'm here, making my first contribution, even if it's small. Sometimes the hardest part isn't the code - it's believing your participation actually matters. So here it is. My first merged PR. Hopefully the first of many.",

    "title": "Building Tools That Spark Joy",
    "story": "My open source journey has been about creating tools that I wish existed. It started with small utilities to solve my own problems, then evolved into projects like Vitest, Slidev, and UnoCSS. What drives me is the idea of developer experience - making tools that are not just functional, but delightful to use. I believe good DX isn't just about performance or features, it's about the small details that make developers smile. Every project I work on, whether it's a testing framework or a presentation tool, starts with the question: 'How can this be more enjoyable?' Open source taught me that when you build something useful and share it freely, amazing things happen. People contribute, iterate, and build upon your ideas in ways you never imagined. Hacktoberfest represents this spirit perfectly - it's about collaboration, learning, and giving back to the community that has given us so much. My advice: don't wait for the perfect idea. Build what you need, share it openly, and be surprised by what the community creates together.",

    "title": "Lessons from Building Runtime Environments",
    "story": "Creating Node.js taught me that sometimes the best ideas come from questioning established patterns. I wanted JavaScript on the server because V8 made it possible, and the async I/O model felt right. Years later with Deno, I got to revisit those decisions with hindsight. The mistakes I made with Node.js - the module system, security model, build complexity - became opportunities to do better. Open source is iterative. You release something, the community uses it in ways you never imagined, and you learn. Node became bigger than I ever expected, and that taught me humility. Your code will outlive your involvement in it. Make it count, but also be willing to let go and let others steer. The most rewarding part isn't the downloads or stars - it's seeing people build amazing things you never thought possible.",

    "title": "Convention Over Configuration Changed Everything",
    "story": "When I extracted Ruby on Rails from Basecamp, I was just trying to avoid repeating myself. I was tired of writing the same boilerplate for every web app. The insight was simple: most web applications need the same things, so why not make those the defaults? Convention over configuration wasn't about being clever - it was about being lazy in the right way. Open source gave Rails wings I could never have given it alone. Thousands of developers contributed patterns, gems, and ideas that made it exponentially better. What I learned: Strong opinions, weakly held. Be opinionated in your design, but listen when the community shows you a better way. The web needed Rails-like frameworks, and Rails needed the community. It's a beautiful symbiosis.",

    "story": "I've created hundreds of open source projects - Express, Commander, Mocha, and countless others. People ask how I stay productive, but honestly, it's about curiosity more than discipline. I build tools because I want to explore ideas. Express came from wanting a minimal web framework for Node. Then I got curious about Go and built similar tools there. Some projects took off, others didn't, and that's okay. The real value isn't in any single project - it's in the collective learning and the community that forms around solving problems together. My advice: Don't get too attached to your code. Build it, ship it, move on to the next idea. Let the community decide what's valuable. Some of my weekend experiments became critical infrastructure for millions of developers. You never know what will resonate.",

    "story": "When I created Ruby, I wanted a language that made me happy. Not fast, not powerful - happy. I believed that developer joy was as important as technical efficiency. Many people thought this was naive, but the community proved them wrong. Ruby's expressiveness and the principle of least surprise resonated with developers who were tired of fighting their tools. Open source showed me that when you optimize for humans instead of machines, something magical happens. People don't just use your software - they fall in love with it. They contribute, evangelize, and build entire ecosystems around it. Ruby on Rails amplified this beyond my wildest dreams. The lesson: technical excellence matters, but never forget that code is written by humans for humans. Make it joyful.",

    "title": "Teaching Through Code and Community",
    "story": "My journey in open source has always been intertwined with education. Through Processing, p5.js, and YouTube tutorials, I've tried to make creative coding accessible to everyone. What I love about open source in education is that the code itself becomes a teaching tool. Students can read it, modify it, break it, and learn from it. The Coding Train community taught me that the best way to learn is by doing - and by sharing your mistakes publicly. I mess up in my videos all the time, and that's the point. It shows that programming is iterative, messy, and human. Open source is the perfect medium for this kind of learning because everything is transparent. You can see the evolution of ideas, the bugs, the fixes, the discussions. It's not just about the final product - it's about the journey.",

    "story": "I've always believed that AI and deep learning should be accessible to everyone, not just researchers at big tech companies. That's why I've open sourced educational tools like micrograd and nanoGPT - these aren't production frameworks, they're learning tools. By stripping neural networks down to their bare essentials and implementing them from scratch, people can actually understand what's happening under the hood. Open source in AI is critical because these technologies are too important to be locked behind closed doors. When I was at Tesla and OpenAI, I saw how powerful these tools could be. But the real power comes when everyone can learn, experiment, and contribute. My YouTube lectures and GitHub repos are my way of giving back - showing people that you don't need a PhD or corporate resources to understand and build AI systems. You just need curiosity and access to open knowledge.",

    "story": "I created JavaScript in 10 days at Netscape in 1995, and it's been evolving ever since. People love to criticize its quirks, and honestly, some of that criticism is fair - I had to work fast and made compromises. But what amazes me is how the community took this scrappy little language and turned it into the foundation of modern web development. Open standards and open source saved JavaScript. TC39, Node.js, npm, frameworks like React and Vue - none of this was my doing alone. The community took JavaScript far beyond what I imagined. The lesson here is that your initial implementation doesn't have to be perfect. What matters is building something extensible that the community can improve. JavaScript succeeded not because it was perfectly designed, but because it was open enough to evolve. That's the power of open source and open standards working together.",

    "story": "Vue.js started as a side project when I was working at Google. I wanted a simpler alternative to Angular for personal projects. I shared it on GitHub, not expecting much. The response was overwhelming. What I learned: you don't need permission to start. Build something you need, make it open source, and see if others find it useful. The hardest part was transitioning to full-time open source through Patreon and sponsorships. It felt risky leaving a stable job, but the community support made it possible. Now Vue supports millions of developers, and I get to work on what I love every day. Open source isn't just about code - it's about building sustainable communities.",

My GitHub began as a space to test ideas — from basic Python scripts to gesture-controlled tools and ERP systems. I didn’t wait for permission to start. I built what intrigued me. One project led to another. Before I knew it, someone messaged me asking if they could use my code in their application. That moment shifted my mindset. My personal learning tools were becoming public resources. Transitioning from just 'coding for fun' to building meaningful, open tools wasn’t easy. It meant learning in the open, facing critiques, managing college responsibilities — and still showing up to write better code. But with every commit, I got better. Today, I focus on building data-driven apps, exploring AI, and sharing what I learn. My dream is to contribute to health tech, develop tools with real impact, and help others grow along the way. Open source taught me that you don’t need to be perfect — you just need to begin. My GitHub is the record of that journey.",
